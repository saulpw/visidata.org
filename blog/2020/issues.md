# Github Issues Procedure

Hi VisiDaters!

Over the past few years our approach and relationship to Github Issues has evolved.
Our current approach is working reasonably for us, but it might be confusing to some people at first.
So we wanted to write up a blog post to clearly outline what our current process is.

GitHub issues are a big source of tension in Open Source.
A healthy stream of bug reports, feature requests, and conversation are the bread and butter for an open source community.
We adore them.
They help communicate to us how VisiData is used, and how it can be made even awesomer.
Hearing about users' unique workflows is a definite highlight for us.
Getting a really detailed issue with sample data and an easy repro can make it so frictionless that it hardly feels like work to fix or implement it.

The dark side of issues is that there are many users with many desires, and only two committed contributors.
Saying No on an issue can sometimes be quite a fraught thing, sometimes escalating into debates. over our No. 
We are hoping that this process will help make the GitHub issues more of a place of opportunity, instead of a source of dread for the two of us.

## The Process

[@saulpw](https://github.com/saulpw) decides what goes into the VisiData core.
He has a strong preference that issues are only left open if they are part of the current Roadmap.
This is so that our open issues are actually representative of the planned, confirmed work for VisiData.

If the feature request ends up making it onto [@saulpw](https://github.com/saulpw)'s Roadmap for the current release, he will mention that in a comment, and leave it open.

If the feature request does not make it make it onto the Roadmap, but the feature is welcome into VisiData, he will mark it as a [\[wishlist\]](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%5Bwishlist%5D+) item, and close it. Anyone is welcome to submit a PR for it (including maybe us, down the line!).

If the feature request is completed, [\[wishlist\]](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%5Bwishlist%5D+) -> [done].

If the feature request is not welcome in VisiData, [\[wishlist\]](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%5Bwishlist%5D+) -> [sorry]

If you want to encourage code contributions for a feature request, please add an emoji to the Original Posting, or a comment if you have something to add (no "me too" posts). The `repeat-last` and `repeat-input` commands are examples of a feature request that had been added to the roadmap, partly because [several users indicated interest](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/441).

We hope that this encourages people to freely share their hopes and dreams with us, knowing that we are being mindful about how we channel our limited time and energy.
We also hope that [the VisiData wishlist](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%5Bwishlist%5D+) can help provide a source of inspiration for potential contributors. Consider submitting a PR, and making a bunch of people happy.
Thanks so much for all of your ongoing support, and please take care of yourselves, and the people you share space with. May you live in less interesting times.
